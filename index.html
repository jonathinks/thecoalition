			<p>We are a group of young people spread around the world who have gathered around the idea that the current education system is inadequate for achieving a sustainable and peaceful world. We as individuals work on a wide range of projects that challenge the education system in different ways while sharing inspiration and finding synergies. The projects we work on are learner-centered education advocacy, open protocols for decentralized accreditation, language learning for cultural understanding and empathy, research in adaptive and personalized learning, and learner-centered migrant school curriculum design.

			<p>We don’t believe a single actor can, nor should, come with a silver-bullet solution. Creating the conditions for an educated and informed population is a collective effort with many actors coming together using their unique strengths and perspectives. As designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, researchers, software developers and teachers we contribute with different ideas and solutions.

			<h4>Dana Gretton - Decentralized Accreditation for Education</h4>
			<p>Meeting #2, 2017-10-23</p>
			<p>Dana Gretton is a recent MIT graduate in EECS who believes that quality universal education is a cornerstone of a sustainable global future. He is developing a decentralized system of accreditation to provide a trustworthy way for people to get credit for teaching other people, formally or informally, and implementing it in such a way that quality teachers get reliably accredited and poor teachers don't. He currently works at the MIT Media Lab as a laboratory technician for robotically automated biological experiments researching gene drives and directed evolution.
