			<p>Our name is a bit vauge, we know. However, it's very much on purpose. They challenges we are out to tackle are not easy to define, but related to the transfer of knowledge between humans. We believe the wicked problems humankind is facing will be incredibly hard to solve unless we as humans find better ways of sharing knowledge, perspectives and skills with each other. This transfer of knowledge needs to happen on a scale not seen before, enabled by the technological advances that has yet to be distributed equally across society.<br>We are a group of young individuals who are not satisfied with our own experience as young learners, despite attending to some of the most renowned institutions around the world. We want to make sure our younger brothers and sisters, and our future selves, have better tools and resources for achieving our personal goals and reaching our full potential as both individuals and society.

			<p>We are not looking to provide a single best solution, but rather working our own passion projects, sharing perspectives and looking for synergies of how these projects can form the basis for a new way of learning and growing, as the industrial-era educational system is being increasingly scrutinized. We believe the key in solving big challenges is to apply a systems thinking lens, to deeply engage and understand the current system, while looking for opportunities of how to design the future . Our diversity is therefore our biggest strength as we come together once a week across five time zones to share our perspectives and engage in conversation. Our backgrounds and expertise cross the boundaries between business, culture geography, education, design, engineering, mathematics, political science and software development. If you would like to share your project ideas or give feedback to others, please write an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hello@jonathannylander.se">hello@jonathannylander.se</a>.
